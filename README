Description
===========
novoBreak is a tool used in cancer genomic studies to discover SV (both somatic and germline)
breakpoints. It can report accurate breakpoints of Deletions (DEL), Duplications (DUP), Inversions (INV) and
Translocations (TRA) (you should consider some of them are mobile elements insertions or templated
insertions). For novel insertions, we may only report the breakpoints but not the inserted
sequence. Please forget about novel insertions at the moment. We will work on that later. It
was designed for Illumina paired-end data.

System requirements and dependency
==================================
novoBreak runs on a x86_64 Linux system with a ~100GB physical memory. It depends on SSAKE
for local assembly, bwa-mem for contig mapping and samtools and picard(SamToFastq) to extract
reads. I have already put them in the release. If you cannot run the dependencies, please download
the lastest versions of these tools.

Installation
============
Currenly I only release the binary version for your courtesy. You can copy the executables and
scripts to your specific location (Your bin for example). Please also add the directory to your
PATH.

Usage
=====
Preprocessing: please remove adaptor contaminations (no need to trim low quality bases) before mapping raw
              reads to the reference. For virus integration analysis, please add the virus genome(s) to reference.
			  The integration should be a TRA event.
Input files: a reference sequence file and two bam files (tumor and normal) of mapping results of
			 the paired-end reads
Output file: a filtered high confident VCF file (novoBreak.pass.flt.vcf). I left the intermedium
             files. You can delete them or inspect them as you need.

run novoBreak:
***The shell script for easy (hopefully) run of novoBreak is in the release directory. You can tune the
parameters as you wish.***

bash <A_PATH>/novoBreak/run_novoBreak.sh <novoBreak_exe_dir> <ref> <tumor_bam> <normal_bam> <n_CPUs:INT>

NEWS
====
20150814: Updated cluster module. Improved speed a lot. 
20150924: Introduced multiple-core for the shell script. Further improved speed. 
20151009: novoBreak can directly read from bam files. No raw fastq files required. Save lots of space. Should have done earlier!
